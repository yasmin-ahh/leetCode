Given an integer array nums, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array. 

All permutations of the array should be equally likely as a result of the shuffling.

## Implement the Solution class:

Solution(int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer array nums.

int[] reset() Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.

int[] shuffle() Returns a random shuffling of the array.

## Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50

-106 <= nums[i] <= 106

All the elements of nums are unique.

At most 104 calls in total will be made to reset and shuffle.
